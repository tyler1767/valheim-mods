# Backpacks

A simple mod that adds a simple backpack. Might do a lot more than that in the future. We have big plans.

Assets provided by CookieMilk. Thanks a lot!

Can be installed on a server, to enforce the configuration.

### Something that vaguely resembles a change log

#### V1.0.4

Iron Gate made me update the mod with their Valheim update today. Sometimes, I am wondering where it all went wrong. It started out with a simple "Wow, this game is way too easy, I'll make a mod that lets creatures spawn with up to 5 stars." about two years ago. Can't really remember what happened after that, but here I am, managing 70 mods and 30 of them need updates today. About 20 mods in, I am really starting to regret my life choices.

#### V1.0.3

There is a config option that can prevent players from putting backpacks with items inside into a chest, turning the chest into some kind of infinite wormhole for items. Modding would be fun, if it wasn't for the users. How dare you coming up with stuff like that.

#### V1.0.2

Someone said that backpack weight should be a slider. I thought a lot about it, to be able to disagree, but couldn't come up with an argument. So, it's a slider now, have fun.

#### V1.0.1

In the beginning God created the backpacks. The backpacks were without config options and couldn't be used on servers, for all the cheaters would abuse the backpacks. And the spirit of God was hovering over the backpacks.
Then God said 'Let there be config options'; and there were config options. And god saw the config options, that they were good; and God decided that the backpacks can now be used on servers.
