### Description
When pressing the hotkey (default Left Shift or Left Bumper on controller) the player will automatically harvest all pickupable items of the same type in a radius around the target. This is mainly intended for assisting with farming, but also works on world spawn pickups like rocks/sticks/berries.

Additionally, when planting crops, if the hotkey is held will plant in a grid around the original target plant (5x5 default size).


Grid size and hotkeys are configurable via the F1 BepInEx menu, as well as a setting to ignore stamina when mass planting (useful for larger grid sizes).
